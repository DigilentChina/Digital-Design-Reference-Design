2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer spi_0_sck_iobuf/IBUF (in spi_0_sck_iobuf macro) has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer spi_0_ss_iobuf_0/IBUF (in spi_0_ss_iobuf_0 macro) has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/MUL_Unit_I/Use_HW_MUL.Using_DSP48_Architectures.No_MUL64.dsp_module_I2/Using_DSP48E1.DSP48E1_I1 input A B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/MUL_Unit_I/Use_HW_MUL.Using_DSP48_Architectures.dsp_module_I1/Using_DSP48E1.DSP48E1_I1 input A B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/MUL_Unit_I/Use_HW_MUL.Using_DSP48_Architectures.No_MUL64.dsp_module_I3/Using_DSP48E1.DSP48E1_I1 output P is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/MUL_Unit_I/Use_HW_MUL.Using_DSP48_Architectures.dsp_module_I1/Using_DSP48E1.DSP48E1_I1 output P is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

IOCS-1#1 Warning
IOB clock sharing  
IOs spi_0_io1_io, reset_tri_io[0:0] placed at A17, A16 connects to flops which are clocked by design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_out2, design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_out1.  Pushing these flops into IOB may cause PAR to fail because the clock route is shared between adjacent (differential pair) IOs.  If there are only two clocks packing them in different BELs might fix the problem, like INST IOB1_flop = BEL FF1 and INST IOB2_flop = BEL FF2.
