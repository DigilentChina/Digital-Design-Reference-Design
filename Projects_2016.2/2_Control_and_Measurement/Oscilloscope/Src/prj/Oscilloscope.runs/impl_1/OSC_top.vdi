WARNING: [Constraints 18-647] Placement may not be routable. The following cell(s) are grouped together and are placed in one single tile. The total number of clocks on non-clock pins of these cells is greater than 2, therefore, placer is not able to legalize the design to satisfy the suggested number of clocks that can drive non-clock pins in a single tile. Please modify the design such that each cell has at most 2 clocks driving its non-clock pins. Also, if one or more cells should be grouped together and placed in one tile, make sure the total number of such clocks does not exceed the maximum suggested.

WARNING: [Constraints 18-643] Placement may not be routable as design contains luts and/or flops whose data pins are driven by global clock signals and final placement is such that the number of such signals exceed the suggested number of such clocks in a single tile, which is 2.

Phase 3.7 Small Shape Detail Placement
WARNING: [Constraints 18-647] Placement may not be routable. The following cell(s) are grouped together and are placed in one single tile. The total number of clocks on non-clock pins of these cells is greater than 2, therefore, placer is not able to legalize the design to satisfy the suggested number of clocks that can drive non-clock pins in a single tile. Please modify the design such that each cell has at most 2 clocks driving its non-clock pins. Also, if one or more cells should be grouped together and placed in one tile, make sure the total number of such clocks does not exceed the maximum suggested.
nolabel_line172/cnt[9]_i_6

WARNING: [Constraints 18-643] Placement may not be routable as design contains luts and/or flops whose data pins are driven by global clock signals and final placement is such that the number of such signals exceed the suggested number of such clocks in a single tile, which is 2. The following clock nets need to be routed to non-clock pins in tile CLBLM_L_X22Y46:

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net u_ram/red[2]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_ram/rom_vopp_u_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell u_ram/rom_vopp_u_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-157) Slice clock routing - For SLICE_X34Y46: more than 2 non-clock pins of the SLICE are driven by different global clocks. This condition should be corrected as it easily becomes congested and will fail to route.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT nolabel_line172/cnt[9]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 11 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    nolabel_line172/clk_AD_reg {FDRE}
    nolabel_line172/cnt_reg[0] {FDRE}
    nolabel_line172/cnt_reg[1] {FDRE}
    nolabel_line172/cnt_reg[2] {FDRE}
    nolabel_line172/cnt_reg[3] {FDRE}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT nolabel_line172/u_debounce/inst/o__0 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    nolabel_line172/key_cnt_reg[0] {FDRE}
    nolabel_line172/key_cnt_reg[1] {FDRE}
    nolabel_line172/key_cnt_reg[2] {FDRE}
